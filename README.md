# Magic The Database!
## Intro
I wanted to create a community page for players of the card game Magic The Gathering.  I wanted users to be able to browse cards, add their favorite cards to a list, build a deck, and post that deck to have other members review and comment on it.

## Tech Used
* Materialize CSS
* Heroku for app hosting
* Node Modules:
* bCrypt - for encrypting user password information
* Express
* eJS
* Passport
* Request
* Sequelize
